The city name has mythological connections, as it is claimed that Arjuna was blessed by Lord Shiva at the top of the Indrakeeladri Hill and after that Arjuna created Vijayawada. According to another myth, Goddess Durga rested here after killed a demon and that is why the place got its name. Nonetheless, Vijayawada is a veritable paradise for people to learn more about the region's history and culture.

The hill offers some amazing vistas of the city. There are two routes to the temple. One can take the stairs leading to the temple which can be difficult and arduous. The one route is driving up the Ghat road. Along both routes there are ancient inscriptions that reveal the stories from the ancient times.

This stupa was built in the 3rd century BC during the reign of King Ashoka. It had gateway at each cardinal point. While these structures are no longer there, one of the gateways was meticulously reconstructed. The carvings on the gateway highlight the life of Buddha.

The museum is fascinating.</p>

	<h4>Undavalli Caves</h4>
<p>
	The Undavalli Caves date back to the 7th century BC and are prime example of rock-cut architecture. The caves are about 8 kilometres from Vijayawada and offer a unique perspective into ancient religious practices. The caves are carved out of sandstone on the side of a hill. While there are many caves, the largest is the one that is most popular for its huge monolith of Lord Vishnu in the reclining posture. This monolith is made from a single granite block and is located on the second storey of the temple, which has a total of four stories. It is believed that the caves were originally used by Jain monks because of its Udayagiri and Khandgiri architectural styles. The main cave is a prime example of Gupta architecture style, which concentrated on primitive rock-cut monastery cells.
